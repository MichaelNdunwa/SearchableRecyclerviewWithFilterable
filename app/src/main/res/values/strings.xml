    <string name="deep_work_description">Cal Newport is the founder of the term “Deep Work”: a way
        of focusing without distraction on a cognitively demanding task, making you better at what
        you are doing, letting you achieve more in less time and providing you with a sense of true
        fulfillment in mastering the skill.
        Newport claims that too many of us have lost the ability to dig deep into their work.
        Instead all of us are being distracted by a constant stream of emails, message notifications
        and social media buzzes. In his book Newport shows the reader methods others have used to get
        into a zone of deep work and surprises with suggestions like the one that serious professionals
        should get rid of social media and that we all should practice being bored again.</string>
